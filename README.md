This is game called PIG. It is based on simple mathematical logic.In this game first the user will have to specify the number of players and then the game will begin. 
First player1 will roll the dice and continue to roll as much number of times he/she wants to roll and the results of each roll will be added and that sum will be the 
final result for that term. Then the next player's term will begin. The total score will be the sum of scores at the end of each term. The first player to reach score 
of 50 will be winner. But the catch is if a players gets 0 on a rollthen that term will end and his/her total score will come down to zero. The next player will begin 
from that point.
